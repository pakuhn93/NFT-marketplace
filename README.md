# Network Fantasy Trading - NFT-marketplace

The project aims to develop a backend and frontend application for a virtual marketplace where users can browse, view, and buy virtual items. The application will be built using Node.js with the Express framework, utilizing Sequelize as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to interact with a MySQL database. JavaScript will be the primary programming language used for implementing the backend logic.
